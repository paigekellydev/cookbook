Hey Mom,

I told you I would send you a recipe for the pork tenderloin that we
have made recently and was delicious.  I have attached that.  I also
attached the actual recipe for my ham, cheese and asparagus stuffed
chicken breasts.
I think I gave this one to you, but I did it from memory, so here is the
actual recipe.
